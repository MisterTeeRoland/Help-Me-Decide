# Help Me Decide (powered by Yelp)

A web application that helps a user decide what to do or where to eat, based of a group chosen options, and then presents businesses using the Yelp Fusion API.

Have you ever been hungry but couldn't decide on what you wanted?
Have you ever wanted to go out, but couldn't decide what to do?

Help Me Decide is your solution.

Pick a category, pick what you're willing to do, and let the program decide for you!
